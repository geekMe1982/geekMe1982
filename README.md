##### Hi there, I'm Adam, a passionate self-taught iOS developer and a freelance language teacher from Egypt. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
